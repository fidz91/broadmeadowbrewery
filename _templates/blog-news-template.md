Write your opening paragraph here. You can use standard Markdown formatting throughout the post:

## Section Heading

Write paragraphs as normal text. Use `**bold text**` for emphasis, `*italics*` for subtle callouts, and `` `inline code` `` for numbers like `66.0°C` or `1.048 OG`.

### Bullet Lists & Notes

- **First Point**: Details here.
- **Second Point**: Details here.
- **Third Point**: Details here.

> "Use a `>` symbol at the start of a line to create a styled pull-quote or tasting note callout."

## Adding Your Own Photos

To use your own photos instead of Unsplash links:
1. Drop your image file into the `public/images/` folder (e.g. `public/images/my-brewday.jpg`).
2. For `heroImage` at the top of the file, use `"/broadmeadowbrewery/images/my-brewday.jpg"`.
3. Inside the post body, embed images with:
   `![Description of photo](/broadmeadowbrewery/images/my-brewday.jpg)`
