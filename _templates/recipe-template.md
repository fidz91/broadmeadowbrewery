Write your introduction paragraph here—what inspired this recipe, what style guidelines or commercial benchmarks you were aiming for, and how this iteration came together.

## Grist & Malt Philosophy

Explain why you chose the base malt and specialty grains:
- **Base Malt (`88%`)**: What character does it bring?
- **Specialty Grains (`12%`)**: How do they contribute to color, body, or foam stability?

## Hop Schedule & Water Chemistry

Describe your bittering and aroma strategy, along with why your water profile (`SO₄:Cl` ratio and target mash pH) suits this style.

## Fermentation & Conditioning

Walk through yeast pitch rate, fermentation temperature control, spunding/carbonation level, and conditioning time.

## Tasting Notes & Next Iteration Tweaks

- **Appearance**: Color, clarity, and head retention.
- **Aroma**: Malt, hop, and yeast aromatics.
- **Flavor & Mouthfeel**: Balance, finish, and body.
- **What I'd Change Next Time**: Any tweaks planned for the next batch.
